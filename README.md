# Screen Tracker: Privacy-First Research Tool

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy By Design

This screen-tracking application is built with security and user privacy as core principles. We've designed it from the ground up to be:

- **100% Open Source**: Every line of code is available for public review
- **OS-Sandboxed**: Runs with minimal permissions inside standard OS security boundaries
- **Transparent**: Collects only what's needed, nothing more
- **Fully Opt-In**: Nothing happens until you explicitly choose to participate
- **User-Controlled**: Pause or stop collection instantly at any time

## 📊 What We Collect (And What We Don't)

### Collected:
- Screenshots of your visible screen only
- Mouse and keyboard actions
- Anonymous session UUID

### Never Collected:
- Personal identifiers or location data
- Passwords
- Clipboard contents
- Wallet keys or extension data
- Audio or webcam data
- Network traffic or process lists

## 🔒 Wallet & Crypto Security

This app **CANNOT** access or compromise cryptocurrency wallets because:

1. It operates as a passive recorder only
2. It never captures clipboard content
3. It has zero browser extension privileges
4. It cannot bypass wallet confirmation dialogs
5. It cannot read or record seed phrases

## 🔍 Security Measures

- **Public Code Review**: All code is on GitHub for security researchers to inspect
- **OS Sandboxing**: Uses standard app sandboxing on all platforms
- **Least-Privilege Design**: Requests minimal system access

## 🧪 Why This Matters

Your contributed data helps researchers build the next generation of open-source computer-use AI assistants that:

- Understand on-screen context accurately
- Provide accessibility assistance
- Remain transparent and free from corporate control

All trained models will be released under open licenses.

## 🔄 User Controls

- **Opt-In**: The app does nothing until you press Start
- **Pause/Stop Anytime**: One click to immediately cease recording
- **Delete Your Data**: You can delete the data anytime before hitting the upload button

## 🔗 Precedents & Track Record

This approach follows established patterns by respected organizations like Mozilla's Firefox telemetry program and academic research projects such as Screen2Vec, which have safely collected screen interaction data for years.

## 💬 We Value Your Feedback

We built this project to advance open science, not to compromise anyone's security. If you have concerns or suggestions, please reach out—your feedback makes this tool stronger and safer for everyone.
